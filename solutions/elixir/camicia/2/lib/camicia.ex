defmodule Camicia do
  @doc """
    Simulate a card game between two players.
    Each player has a deck of cards represented as a list of strings.
    Returns a tuple with the result of the game:
    - `{:finished, cards, tricks}` if the game finishes with a winner
    - `{:loop, cards, tricks}` if the game enters a loop
    `cards` is the number of cards played.
    `tricks` is the number of central piles collected.

    ## Examples

      iex> Camicia.simulate(["2"], ["3"])
      {:finished, 2, 1}

      iex> Camicia.simulate(["J", "2", "3"], ["4", "J", "5"])
      {:loop, 8, 3}
